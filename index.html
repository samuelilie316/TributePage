            Julius Robert Oppenheimer was an American theoretical physicist and
            director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during
            World War II. He is often credited as the "father of the atomic

              At 22 April 1904 was born Julius Robert Oppenheimer in New York
              City, U.S.
            </li>
            <li>
              Oppenheimer earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Harvard
              University in 1925
            </li>
            <li>
              Also he earned a doctorate in physics from the University of
              GÃ¶ttingen in Germany in 1927
            </li>
            <li>
              After research at other institutions, he joined the physics
              department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he
              became a full professor in 1936
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited to work on the Manhattan
              Project, and in 1943 was appointed director of the project's Los
              Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico
            </li>
            <li>
              On July 16, 1945, he was present at the first test of the atomic
              bomb, Trinity
            </li>
            <li>
              n August 1945, the weapons were used against Japan in the bombings
              of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That remains the only use of nuclear
              weapons in an armed conflict.
            </li>
            <li>
              On December 16, 2022, Jennifer Granholm, the U.S. Secretary of
              Energy, ordered that the 1954 decision to revoke Oppenheimer's
              security clearance be vacated.
